This “Plant The Seed” is a simulation-based farming game developed using Scala, JFXApp, and Scene Builder. 
It allows players to manage a virtual garden by planting crops, purchasing seeds, and selling harvested plants to earn coins. 
Crops: wheat, corn, carrots, strawberries, and watermelons. 

Instruction: Players begin by selecting the crop to plant on available garden plots, choosing which crop to grow based on their specific growth time and profit. Once the crops mature, they can be harvested and sold for coins, which can be reinvested in purchasing new seeds, creating a continuous cycle of plant, growth, harvest, and resource management.

Goal: Earn coins and unlock new seed varieties, expand the variety of crops in the garden and optimize your farming strategies. 

Current version - lack of a countdown timer for crops growth. This limitation prevents players from fully engaging with the intended gameplay mechanics and experiencing the complete lifecycle of their crops.
